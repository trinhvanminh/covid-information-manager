# Fork về Github, rồi clone về nhé mọi người

### Steps when working with Git/Github:
    - ALWAYS pull from master to update newest source code
    - Checkout new branch to work on your feature. Convention: feature/[feature-name], fix/[bug-name],…
    - Try to do small commits to boost your contributes and easier to revert
    - Push code, create PR and assign all members as a reviewer.And remember: DONT MERGE PR WITHOUT REVIEW OR PUSH CODE DIRECTLY TO MASTER BRANCH
    - Wait for review. You should review your own code before create PR.
